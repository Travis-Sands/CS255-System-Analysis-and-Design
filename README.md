# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

DriverPass is a driving school, that wants to offer online learning resources and a way for their users to schdeule driving sessions with one of their driving instructors. They wanted a system that could be accessed via computer or cellular device. I think I did a good job of capturing what DriverPass wanted out of their system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Everything can always use revising and improvement. I would start with my use case diagram and make it more clear and legible. This would help with readability, making it easier to understand. I would also seperate the admin user so that there would be a seprate user for employees.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I kept the user in mind by thinking of ease of use. I did this by having provind detail into how different parts of the system should work with the user. If the user needs are not met than then user will potentially became fustrated and not want to use the system. If you keep the user in mind in the design process this will be able to conveyed and impelemented into the programming phase. We must remember that the systems are being built for a user to interact with it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach desiging software around the business requirements and the needs of the user. If you only take into account one or the other the system will be extremly one sided, when systems are being built they are typically being designed so that a user can interact with the business in some way. Taking into account use cases and user case diagrams help align how these two aspects into the design.
